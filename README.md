# ESP32
The ESP32 is a versatile microcontroller and an all-in-one Wi-Fi and (in some models) Bluetooth system-on-chip (SoC) suitable for a spectrum of applications, from embedded systems to DIY electronics projects, especially those involving Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Distinguished by its extensive array of peripheral interfaces, including SPI, I2C, UART, I2S, PWM, ADC, DAC, and more, the ESP32 seamlessly integrates with an eclectic range of components such as sensors, displays, motors, and various external devices. This rich assortment of interfaces empowers creators to embark on projects with boundless possibilities and functionalities.

For my own projects, I opted for the LOLIN D32 model, a development board meticulously crafted around the ESP32 microcontroller by Wemos.
