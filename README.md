# ESP32 Microcontroller

The ESP32 is a versatile microcontroller and an all-in-one Wi-Fi and (in some models) Bluetooth system-on-chip (SoC) suitable for a spectrum of applications, from embedded systems to DIY electronics projects, especially those involving Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Distinguished by its extensive array of peripheral interfaces, including SPI, I2C, UART, I2S, PWM, ADC, DAC, and more, the ESP32 seamlessly integrates with an eclectic range of components such as sensors, displays, motors, and various external devices. This rich assortment of interfaces empowers creators to embark on projects with boundless possibilities and functionalities.

For my own projects, I opted for the LOLIN D32 model, a development board meticulously crafted around the ESP32 microcontroller by Wemos.

## Motivation

During my regular trips to Taiwan, I delegate the responsibility of tending my plants to a reliable friend. While this arrangement suffices, I can't help but feel a tinge of remorse. 

*"What if I could remote control the water system when I was in Taiwan?"*

Driven by my curiosity about ESP32 technology, I embarked on a project to develop an automated watering system. Since most of the components are required for this system, but I also want to try other different projects, I resolved to document the entire process meticulously. Before the next visit back to Taiwan, I will learn as much as possible. The following is an account of my initial efforts in this undertaking.
